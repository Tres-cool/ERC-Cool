**ERC-Cool: The internets carbon removing standard.**

**About the Project:**
Introducing 'ERC-Cool', a carbon-removing smart contract interface compatible with any standard smart contract. It integrates real-world, perpetual carbon removal into any contract, transforming tokenized assets into effective tools against climate change. So, the things we love can become verifiable climate action. 

**The Motivation of ERC-Cool:**
At Tres Cool we aim to revolutionize climate action and make it accessible, enjoyable, and cool-enhancing for everyone. We want to create carbon removal and positive action that's a vibe. With the ERC-Cool we make it possible for anything we tokenize to become a planet-cooling, sustainable digital public good. It's time to turn the things we love into icons for change. ERC-Cool is designed to set an entirely new standard for collective climate action, accessible to every corner of the internet.

**How It Works:**
ERC-Cool is made to cool. A carbon removal interface that is triggered by a flow of funds through our smart contract. As funds flow, the contract directs funds to purchase high quality, permanent carbon removal credits.  The Carbon is removed from our atmosphere and retired upon maturity. The removal impact is tokenized as Cool Factor (FKTR), where 1 FKTR = 1 KG of Carbon Removed. FKTR is made redeemable to the token holder to act as feedback loop allowing for individual impact tracking down to the gram and to introduce a new form of internet status, backed by positive impact.

**This is not offsetting:**
ERC-Cool is a tool for real, permanent carbon removal, not a shortcut to carbon neutrality. While the best solution to planet-warming is not emitting carbon. The next best thing is to take action and remove the carbon that we do emit. And we mean remove. Not offset.

The ERC-Cool is not designed as a race to buy as many carbon credits as possible to fulfill carbon offsetting claims. The ERC-Cool is designed to remove carbon permanently, while providing early funding to scale tech-based carbon removal solutions. The ERC-Cool is a push for beyond status quo, beyond offsetting - to spark a carbon removal revolution, change the way we act and make sure the world has the solutions needed to cool our planet.
