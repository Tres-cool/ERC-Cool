# About the Project
ERC721Cool is an improved implementation of the ERC721A Non-Fungible Token Standard that uniquely weaves real world perpetual carbon removal to any NFT use case that adopts it.

The goal of ERC721Cool is to provide a planet cooling - sustainable - digital public good. Available to all, without permission. Able to be sprinkled to every corner of the internet and set an entirely new standard of collective climate action.

The carbon is removed from our atmosphere, tokenized and deposited back into the NFT - as an additional asset, at each and every trade. Increasing the fundamental value of the NFT and helping to cool our planet.

The ERC721Cool standard can transform any NFT (e.g. Art, Collectible, Virtual Real Estate, In-Game Item) into a powerful tool to combat climate change and add a layer of additional value to holders.

This project and implementation will be updated regularly and will continue to stay up to date with best practices.
