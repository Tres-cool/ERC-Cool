# ERC-Cool

# About the Project
ERC-Cool is an improved implementation of the ERC721A Non-Fungible Token Standard that uniquely weaves real world perpetual carbon removal to any NFT use case that adopts it.

The goal of ERC-Cool is to provide a planet cooling - sustainable - digital public good. Available to all, without permission. Able to be sprinkled to every corner of the internet and set an entirely new standard of collective climate action.

The carbon is removed from our atmosphere, tokenized and deposited back into the NFT - at each and every trade. 

The ERC-Cool standard can transform any NFT (e.g. Art, Collectible, Virtual Real Estate, In-Game Item) into a powerful tool to combat climate change, that distibutes the value to holders and creators.

This project and implementation will be updated regularly and will continue to stay up to date with best practices.
