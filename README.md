# ERC-Cool

# About the Project
The 'ERC-Cool' is a carbon removing smart contract interface composable with any standard smart contract, to weaves real world, perpetual carbon removal into any  contract that inherits it. Transforming whatever we tokenize into a powerful tool against climate change.

The goal of ERC-Cool is to provide a planet cooling - sustainable - digital public good. Available to all, without permission. Able to be sprinkled to every corner of the internet and set an entirely new standard of collective climate action.

The carbon is removed from our atmosphere, tokenized and made redeemable to the initiating NFT - at each and every trade. 

The ERC-Cool standard can transform any NFT standard (e.g. Art, Collectible, Wearable, Virtual Real Estate, In-Game Item) into a powerful tool to combat climate change.
