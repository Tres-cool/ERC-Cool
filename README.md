# ERC-Cool

# About the Project
The 'ERC-Cool' is a carbon removing smart contract interface composable with any standard smart contract, in order to weave real world, perpetual carbon removal into any  contract that inherits it. Transforming whatever we tokenize into a powerful tool against climate change and turning the things we love into verified climate action.

The goal of ERC-Cool is to provide a planet cooling - sustainable - digital public good. Available to all, without permission and able to be sprinkled to every corner of the internet to set an entirely new standard of collective climate action.

The carbon is removed from our atmosphere and retired. The removal impact is tokenized and made redeemable to the initiating NFT (consumer) in the form of Cool Factor (FKTR, where 1 FKTR = 1 KG of Carbon Removed. Thus providing a feedback loop of inidivual impact down to the gram and a new form of internet status, backed by positive impact.

The ERC-Cool standard aims to proliferate carbon removal, to help scale the carbon removal soltuions we require and to create the kind of climate action everyone wants to be a part of.
